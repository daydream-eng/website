This means that each process can run as independently as possible without waiting for other processing to release resources.</p><p>As a cherry on top, the Daydream Engine is written in Rust, one of the lowest overhead languages available today.</p><h3>Your computer can run it.</h3><p>The Daydream Engine does not target high-end hardware. Instead, mid-range hardware is Daydream's target spec, with progressive enhancements on top. The core Daydream experience can be taken almost anywhere you play, without relying on upsampling or frame generation.</p><p>What's more, the Daydream Engine is built to be cross-platform, including Vulkan support and a Linux native version.</p><p>In particular, Daydream development natively targets a Steam Deck OLED at full resolution and refresh rate when benchmarking performance, to ensure that most full-power hardware can enjoy a rock-solid experience.</p></main><footer><section><h3>Satisfy your curiosity.</h3><p>Get monthly updates on Daydream, with tips and deep discussion.</p><p>And maybe even a few exclusives, just for you. ;)</p><a href="https://ddre.am/news" class="button">Learn more</a></section><section><img alt="Daydream" class="logo-image" src="https://ddre.am/assets/images/logo.png"><p>Â© Daniel P H Fox.
