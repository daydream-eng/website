				an overall sound inspired by the earlier pioneering musical work of <a href="https://c418.org/">Daniel Rosenfeld</a>.</p><p>From there, the OST explores more subtle and lush directions, with a larger emphasis on space & pads, dynamic contrast, and crafting distinct moods for different moments. The goal is to craft a soundtrack that both amplifies every environment you're in, and lets you zone out as you play.</p><h3>Quiet when it needs to be.</h3><p>The Daydream OST is defined by silent moments as much as its music. Instead of running continuous mixes of music as you play, Daydream aims to lean into the sound of the world around you, building up loops and foley to create a world that's sonically alive without taking up space.</p><p>Further, Daydream's OST contains many 'interjections' - gentle, low volume musical motifs that stand on their own without the backing of a full song. Interjections are designed to finely dust music onto scenes, allowing a sparser soundtrack without becoming completely silent.</p><h3>Reflective of the world around you.</h3><p>Daydream will sport a dynamic music director to gently guide song selections as you play. Based on your current surroundings, you'll hear music which evokes different tones and timbres to emphasise where you are at each moment.</p><p>As you explore the depths, you'll hear warmer, contemplative pads and moodier synths. When you return, enjoy sparser, lighter arrangements as you wander a lonely world. Even the time of day and weather affect the music choices you hear!</p></main><footer><section><h3>Satisfy your curiosity.</h3><p>Get monthly updates on Daydream, with tips and deep discussion.</p><p>And maybe even a few exclusives, just for you. ;)</p><a href="https://ddre.am/news" class="button">Learn more</a></section><section><img alt="Daydream" class="logo-image" src="https://ddre.am/assets/images/logo.png"><br><p>Â© Daniel P H Fox.
